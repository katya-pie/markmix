                <p>I thought of this song when we were joking that you're just in my head, and you said that you'd like to wander around in my mind.
                I think at the moment I got shy but I thought that was really romantic. <br>
                This song depicts a really gentle feeling... comfort, safety, curiosity and appreciation. I'd like to walk around in your mind too. 
                I like how dreamy and soft this song is. <br>
                Sometimes one's mind feels like a nightmare and I think you'd probably say that
                your mind isn't always such a nice place to be in, but I think, when I'm with you, I get to see some of it and it feels like this song.

                <p>I added this song because it felt cute and I like Zooey Deschanel. I never paid much attention to the lyrics before but now I really appreciate the way she talks of memories as monuments in one's mind. I miss you.</p>

                <p>This song, to me, is a mix of beauty and tragedy. It feels like trying to hold onto love despite it being so hard. When it's so hard to look at time passing by and things ending. It's not happy... but it's tranquil. I'm not sure why I added it but it spoke to me and I felt like you would like it.</p>

                    The melody of this song depicts how happy and free I felt when I was with you. I don't know why all these songs happen to talk about things being fleeting, I really didn't plan it or realize until I paid more attention to the lyrics. <br>
                    You were like a shooting star.

                    I like that this song depicts a dreamy and hopeful scenario full of uncertainty and chooses to make it light and beautiful with the melody. <br>
                    Being with you felt like that. Like being on a train to an unknown destination. <br>
                    I'm happy we got to know each other. <br>
                    It really felt like a dream. T_T

                    This song, and this artist in general, feels like brain stimming, like when we'd talk about exciting stuff over lunch or while procrastinating on studying

                    I added this song because I felt aggresive about love. I felt full of love. And I felt so angry that people didn't seem to understand why it's so important. But I think you do. I felt it and I think that's one of the things that made me trust you more over time.

                    Time passed by so quickly when we were together. I was kind of scared of how fast it all went by, I was scared I didn't have enough time to process and treasure every minute and I was scared it passed by so qiickly I would forget about it. <br>
                    Truth is that you left a big mark (haha) on me. I may forget some details but I remember the feeling. I remember your face, I remember your words, how warm your hands felt, how your voice sounded. <br>
                    I mentioned this song before. The lyrics go like this: "Lovers don't watch the clock, but in your case, for some reason I remember every minute" <br>

                    Perfect depicts love that is so simple, I understand why some might find it cheesy, boring or flavorless, but I think these people just don't get. I didn't get it for the longest time but now I think I do. There is something so great about love that’s simple.

                    This one time you said you want to show me off to your friends. I was really flattered by that. Agora hills started playing in my head. I like the second verse. <br> 
                    At the risk of sounding shallow or too dirty, I want to say that I can't get your body out of my mind. I love that you're strong and can throw me around but you also have a slutty little waist, and a huge rack. I love your face and your lips, your neck, arms, shoulders, back, your dick, your hands, your skin and how soft it feels and how you smell wether its sweet and like a girl or its your ball sweat.<br>
                    I love your body because its yours. You are soft, gentle, strong, passionate, feminine and masculine and I just want to take a bite, hold it or stare at it at, to say the least.

                    I didn't lose you but I've been feeling blue since you left. Blue over you depicts a kind of sadness that's new to me. It's not depressing or angry, it's a kind of grief that takes you back to that love instead of trying to get rid of it. <br>
                    Also this song makes me think of u cause you like blue.
