                    <p>I thought of this song when we were joking that you're just in my head, and you said that you'd like to wander around in my mind.
                    I think at the moment I got shy but I thought that was really romantic. <br>
                    This song depicts a really gentle feeling... comfort, safety, curiosity and appreciation. I'd like to walk around in your mind too. 
                    I like how dreamy and soft this song is. <br>
                    Sometimes one's mind feels like a nightmare and I think you'd probably say that
                    your mind isn't always such a nice place to be in, but I think, when I'm with you, I get to see some of it and it feels like this song.

                    <p>I added this song because it felt cute and I like Zooey Deschanel. I never paid much attention to the lyrics before but now I really appreciate the way she talks of memories as monuments in one's mind. I miss you.</p>

                    <p>This song, to me, is a mix of beauty and tragedy. It feels like trying to hold onto love despite it being so hard. When it's so hard to look at time passing by and things ending. It's not happy... but it's tranquil. I'm not sure why I added it but it spoke to me and I felt like you would like it.</p>

                    <p>The melody of this song depicts how happy and free I felt when I was with you. I don't know why all these songs happen to talk about things being fleeting, I really didn't plan it or realize until I paid more attention to the lyrics. <br>
                    You were like a shooting star.</p>
